# Bait-Cast-Reel

### A fishing-inspired spinoff of the original "Bop-It" Toy, completed for the University of Pittsburgh's ECE1895: Junior Design Course. 

The toy is shaped like a fishing rod and randomly selects one of three user inputs, which the user must complete within the allocated time window, else the user will lose the game. The three tangible user inputs - "Bait," "Cast," and "Reel," - use 3 different transducers to determine whether or not the user input was successful.
